# Feature: Trade Republic Sync

> Last updated: 2026-08-09

## Context

Trade Republic is a German neobroker popular in France. Picsou syncs portfolio balances and holdings via TR's unofficial WebSocket API. Authentication requires a Python sidecar (`tr-auth`) because TR uses AWS WAF browser challenges that cannot be solved from plain Java HTTP. A CSV import fallback exists for when the automated sync is unavailable.

## How it works

### Authentication (delegated to Python sidecar)

The `TradeRepublicAdapter` delegates auth to the `tr-auth` Python microservice (FastAPI + Playwright, running on port 8001). The Java adapter calls three HTTP endpoints on the sidecar:

1. **`POST /initiate`** -- Sends phone number + PIN. TR dispatches a 2FA code via SMS/app notification. Returns a `processId`.
2. **`POST /complete`** -- Sends processId + verification code (4-digit code in the current Trade Republic flow). Returns `sessionToken` + `refreshToken`.
3. **`POST /refresh`** -- Sends refreshToken. Returns new sessionToken (+ possibly rotated refreshToken).

Credentials (phone/PIN) are never stored -- they are used only for the `/initiate` call and discarded.

Frontend auth state deliberately separates initiation failures from verification
failures:

- If `POST /tr/auth/initiate` fails, the phone/PIN form stays visible, the
  pending TAN and process id are cleared, and the user sees the inline error.
  The UI must not advance to the verification-code step because no valid
  `processId` exists.
- If `POST /tr/auth/complete` fails, the verification-code step stays visible,
  the typed code is cleared, and the current `processId` is kept so the user can
  retry the code without re-entering phone/PIN.

### Session persistence

`TradeRepublicSyncService.completeAuth()` stores tokens in a `TradeRepublicSession` entity and returns immediately with a `SessionStatusResponse`. The initial sync runs **in the background** on a daemon thread (`tr-sync`) using `TransactionTemplate` for programmatic transaction management — the background thread has no Spring-managed EntityManager, so `@Transactional` would not work.

Both `sessionToken` and `refreshToken` are **encrypted at rest** with AES-256-GCM via `CryptoEncryption` before storage, and decrypted on read. The stored `expiresAt` (+2 h at auth/refresh time) is a **heuristic hint, not a hard gate**: on sync, if the session token is expired (`SESSION_EXPIRED` error), the service refreshes using the stored refresh token — this is the normal path for any sync happening hours after auth. Only a refresh **rejected by TR** clears the session and forces re-authentication; the sidecar relays TR's status verbatim, and since TR's refresh endpoint is undocumented/reverse-engineered, the exact rejection code isn't fixed — 401, 403, and 405 have all been observed in practice, so `TradeRepublicAdapter` treats *any* 4xx other than 429 as a rejection (→ `SyncException("SESSION_EXPIRED")`). 429 (TR rate-limit) and 5xx/timeout/empty body (sidecar or TR outage) are transient and keep the session so the next sync can retry. `getSessionStatus` therefore reports the session as active while a refresh token exists, even past `expiresAt` — until a genuine rejection clears it. See [encryption-at-rest.md](./encryption-at-rest.md) for encryption details.

### Data fetching (WebSocket, no sidecar)

The `TradeRepublicAdapter.fetchAccounts()` connects directly to `wss://api.traderepublic.com/` (protocol version 31) using `ReactorNettyWebSocketClient`. No WAF challenge is needed for the WebSocket endpoint. The adapter:

1. Sends a `connect` message with locale, platform info, and client version.
2. Subscribes to `availableCash` (cash balance) and `compactPortfolio`/`compactPortfolioByType` (list of positions with ISIN, netSize, averageBuyIn).
3. For each position, subscribes to `ticker` to get the live market price. Positions with `instrumentType: "privateFund"` (private equity funds) are skipped — TR never sends a price tick for these non-publicly-traded assets, and subscribing would inflate `expectedTickers` causing the reactive stream to hang until the 45s timeout kills the entire sync. Skipped positions fall back to `averageBuyIn` pricing downstream. For all other positions, `compactPortfolioByType` positions carry no `exchangeId`, so the adapter appends one itself: `.LSX` (Lang & Schwarz Exchange, TR's home exchange for equities/ETFs) by default, or `.TRD0` for TR-native crypto ISINs (`XF000...`), which LSX doesn't list. Using the wrong suffix makes TR reject the subscription (`FORBIDDEN`), so the position's ticker price is never received and the sync silently falls back to `averageBuyIn` — see GH issue #23.
4. Computes portfolio value as `sum(ticker.last.price * position.netSize)`.
5. Extracts secAccNo (securities account numbers) from the JWT to handle multiple sub-portfolios. The normal brokerage account is exposed under `act.acc.owner.default`; French PEA accounts are exposed under `act.acc.owner.tax_wrapper_fr`.
6. Builds `TrPosition` records from `positionsByIsin` map: each position includes ISIN, quantity (netSize), averageBuyIn, and currentPrice (from ticker, or averageBuyIn as fallback if ticker price is missing).

Returns a list of `TrAccountData` records: one securities account per TR wrapper (`TR Titres` as `COMPTE_TITRES`, `TR PEA` as `PEA`) and one cash account (`TR Cash`) for the default cash pocket. The PEA cash pocket is scoped with `availableCash(accountNumber=...)` and added to the `TR PEA` balance instead of being shown as a separate checking account.

### Holding deduplication

When persisting holdings, multiple ISINs can convert to the same Yahoo Finance ticker symbol (e.g., different listings of the same security). Before inserting into the database, `upsertAccount()` deduplicates holdings by ticker via the shared `HoldingDedup::vwapMerge` helper — quantities are summed and `averageBuyIn` is the quantity-weighted average. This prevents `DataIntegrityViolationException` on the `(account_id, ticker)` unique constraint AND keeps the cost basis mathematically correct. See [trade-republic-holding-deduplication.md](./trade-republic-holding-deduplication.md) for the VWAP formula and gotchas.

The WebSocket sync treats the returned position list as authoritative. Existing
holdings for a TR account are deleted and recreated on every WebSocket sync; if a
portfolio is returned with an empty position list, stale holdings are cleared. The
CSV fallback imports balances only and therefore does not replace holdings.

### Broker valuation fallback (`provider_value_eur`)

Each persisted holding also stores TR's own EUR valuation of the position in
`provider_value_eur`, with `quote_currency = "EUR"`. The value is
`currentPrice × quantity`, falling back to `averageBuyIn × quantity` when TR's
ticker stream returned no live price — mirroring exactly how `TradeRepublicAdapter`
already builds the account-level `TrAccountData.balanceEur`, so the sum of the
holdings agrees with the **securities subtotal** of that figure by construction.
When several ISINs deduplicate to one ticker, this value is the sum of their
individually rounded broker values rather than the aggregate quantity multiplied
by the first position's price. This preserves the broker subtotal even when the
merged positions carry different live prices.
For a compte-titres that subtotal *is* the account total; for a PEA the total also
includes a scoped cash amount Picsou never persists, so the holdings sum falls
short of `current_balance` by exactly that cash. This is why `V64` can only
backfill accounts that reconcile, and why PEAs are left to self-heal on sync.

This exists because `AccountService.liveBalanceEur` re-values holdings from Yahoo
and **drops** any it cannot price, while the invested side keeps their full cost
basis — an asymmetry that fabricates a loss (GH issue #76). TR positions Yahoo
cannot resolve (unmappable ISINs, thin US OTC listings for Irish/Luxembourg UCITS
ETFs — see [ISIN_TO_TICKER_CONVERSION.md](./ISIN_TO_TICKER_CONVERSION.md) and GH
issue #78) now fall back to this broker figure instead of vanishing.

Treating TR quotes as EUR is not a new assumption: the adapter already sums them
unconverted into `balanceEur`. Writing `quote_currency` makes that assumption
explicit in the schema rather than implicit in the adapter, which is what the
[FX-conversion ADR](../decisions/2026-05-19-yahoo-fx-conversion.md) asked for when
it rejected using the untagged `current_price` column as a fallback.

### CSV import fallback

`TradeRepublicSyncService.importCsv()` parses a CSV file with columns `name,type,balance`. Accounts are deduplicated via a stable external ID derived from the name (`tr_csv_` prefix + slugified name).

### Scheduled sync

`SchedulerService.dailyBankSync()` calls `TradeRepublicSyncService.resyncIfSessionActive()`, which is a no-op if no session exists. An expired session token is not a reason to skip: the sync attempts the stored refresh token first (the daily 08:00 run is always past the 2 h token window, so the refresh path IS the scheduled-sync path).

## Technical choices

| Choice | Why | Rejected alternative |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| Python sidecar for auth | TR uses AWS WAF browser challenge; only a real browser (Playwright) can solve it | Headless Java HTTP (blocked by WAF) |
| WebSocket for data | No WAF on the WS endpoint; direct Java access works; real-time price data | REST API scraping (would also hit WAF) |
| Single session entity (`deleteAll` before save) | Single-user app; only one TR session is meaningful at a time | Multiple sessions (not needed) |
| CSV import fallback | When tr-auth is down or session expired, user can manually export and import | No fallback (bad UX) |
| Protocol version 31 hardcoded | TR protocol is undocumented and reverse-engineered; pinning avoids silent breakage | Dynamic version negotiation (not possible) |
| Input validation with `@NotBlank` on DTOs | Prevents null phone/PIN from reaching Map.of() constructor, which rejects nulls and throws NullPointerException | Try-catch in adapter (less clear, reactive) |
| User-friendly error messages on frontend | HTTP errors from sidecar are technical and nested JSON; frontend parses HTTP status + error codes to show user-friendly messages in both FR and EN | Display raw API error (confusing to users) |
| TrPosition record in port interface | Encapsulates position data (ISIN, quantity, prices) in a named record; returned within TrAccountData | Flatten positions into TrAccountData directly (less structured, harder to evolve) |
| Async background sync after auth | Auth returns immediately (~1s), sync runs on daemon thread. Frontend gets instant feedback, data appears via refetch intervals | Synchronous sync (blocks HTTP request 10-30s, bad UX) |
| `TransactionTemplate` for background sync | Background thread has no Spring proxy/EntityManager. Programmatic tx is the simplest fix. | `@Async` (self-invocation bypasses proxy), `@EnableAsync` (overhead for single use case) |
| `holdingRepository.flush()` after delete | Hibernate may defer the DELETE, causing duplicate key on subsequent INSERT with same `(account_id, ticker)` | Rely on Hibernate flush ordering (unreliable) |

## Docker / deployment

The `tr-auth` sidecar uses `python:3.12-slim` as base (not the official `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python` image) — see [ADR 2026-04-25](../decisions/2026-04-25-tr-auth-sidecar-slim-image.md) for the size rationale (969MB → 547MB release archive). Only Chromium is installed; Firefox and WebKit are skipped. The container runs as a non-root user (`trauth`). Two ordering rules matter:

1. **Chromium system deps must be `apt-get install`-ed manually.** `playwright install --with-deps` would be simpler but fails on Debian bookworm because it tries to install Ubuntu-only font packages (`ttf-unifont`, `ttf-ubuntu-font-family`). The Dockerfile lists the working subset explicitly.
2. **`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` must be set BEFORE `playwright install chromium` runs**, so the browser lands in a directory owned by `trauth`:

```dockerfile
ENV PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/app/playwright-browsers
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt \
    && playwright install chromium
RUN chown -R trauth:trauth /app
USER trauth
```

Without rule 2, Playwright installs to `/root/.cache/ms-playwright/`, which the `trauth` user cannot read → every `/initiate` call throws an unhandled exception → FastAPI returns 500 with no useful error message.

Both compose files (`docker-compose.yml` at repo root and `docker/docker-compose.yml`) reference `services/tr-auth/Dockerfile`, so a fix here applies to both.

## Gotchas / Pitfalls

- **tr-auth must be running**: The Python sidecar must be accessible at `app.tr-auth.url` (default `http://tr-auth:8001`). If it is down, auth calls will timeout after 60 seconds.
- **Local Maven dev uses localhost**: `application-dev.yml` overrides `app.tr-auth.url` to `http://127.0.0.1:8001` because `tr-auth` is a Docker-internal DNS name. When running the backend with `mvn spring-boot:run`, start the sidecar separately on port 8001.
- **tr-auth 500 = Playwright crash**: A generic 500 from the sidecar almost always means the Chromium browser could not launch. Check `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is set and `chown` covers it (see Docker section above). Run `docker logs <tr-auth-container>` to confirm.
- **Dockerfile changes need an explicit rebuild**: `docker compose up -d` does NOT rebuild existing images. After editing `services/tr-auth/Dockerfile`, run `docker compose build tr-auth && docker compose up -d tr-auth`. Symptom of a stale image: `docker compose ps` shows `tr-auth` with a SHA-only `IMAGE` column instead of a tagged name (`picsou-tr-auth` / `docker-tr-auth`), and the runtime error references a path that doesn't match the current Dockerfile (e.g. `/home/trauth/.cache/ms-playwright/` when the new Dockerfile sets `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/app/playwright-browsers`).
- **Input validation is strict**: `InitiateAuthRequest` and `CompleteAuthRequest` DTOs enforce `@NotBlank` on all fields. Empty or null values result in a 422 response before reaching the service layer. Ensure frontend sends valid non-blank values.
- **Initiation errors are not TAN prompts**: a failed `/tr/auth/initiate` call
  has no reliable `processId`, so frontend screens must keep the user on the
  phone/PIN step and clear any stale process id. Only `/tr/auth/complete` errors
  should keep the verification-code step visible for retry.
- **Frontend API field mapping**: Frontend sends `phoneNumber` and `pin` (not `phone` and `pin`). The API uses ISO field names; if frontend is updated, verify the DTO record field names match.
- **Error message parsing on frontend**: Error handling extracts specific error codes from deeply nested JSON responses (e.g., `NUMBER_INVALID`, `PIN_INVALID`, `VALIDATION_CODE_INVALID`). The backend wraps every TR error in a `SyncException`, which `GlobalExceptionHandler` maps to **HTTP 422** with the code in the ProblemDetail `detail` — so the shared `formatTrAuthError()` (`frontend/src/lib/errors.ts`) matches TR codes on both 422 and 5xx via a single `matchTrDetail()` helper. It is used by `TradeRepublicTab`, `AddAccountModal` **and** `SyncAllModal` (the modal surfaces auth and per-row sync errors inline). If the sidecar changes the error response format, update `matchTrDetail()`.
- **Session lifetime is TR's call, not ours**: the stored `expiresAt` (+2 h) is a heuristic; sync always *tries* (refreshing on `SESSION_EXPIRED`) and only a TR-rejected refresh clears the session. If TR invalidates refresh tokens quickly, the user still has to re-authenticate — but that decision now comes from TR's actual response, not a hard-coded clock.
- **WebSocket protocol is reverse-engineered**: The TR WebSocket API is undocumented. Raw responses are logged at INFO level. If TR changes the protocol, the adapter will break and need updating.
- **timeout-driven completion**: The WebSocket session completes when either all data is received (cash + all portfolios + all tickers) or a 30-second timeout is hit.
- **Multiple sub-portfolios / PEA**: The adapter extracts wrapper-specific `secAccNo` values from the JWT and subscribes to each one separately. `default` maps to `TR Titres` (`COMPTE_TITRES`); `tax_wrapper_fr` maps to `TR PEA` (`PEA`). This avoids merging CTO and PEA holdings into a single securities account.
- **Holding deduplication by ticker (VWAP)**: Multiple ISINs can map to the same ticker. When syncing, holdings are deduplicated in-memory before insertion to avoid unique constraint violations. Quantities are summed and `averageBuyIn` is the quantity-weighted average (VWAP) via `HoldingDedup::vwapMerge`. The earlier "keep first averageBuyIn" approach was non-deterministic (HashMap iteration order) and produced wrong gain/loss percentages. See [trade-republic-holding-deduplication.md](./trade-republic-holding-deduplication.md).
- **Empty WebSocket portfolio clears holdings**: If TR returns a securities account
  with zero positions, the sync deletes old holdings for that account so a full sale
  does not leave stale securities visible.
- **TrPosition currentPrice fallback**: When a ticker price is missing (ticker subscription timed out or failed), TrPosition.currentPrice is set to averageBuyIn. This allows the sync to complete without blocking on missing real-time data. Portfolio value calculation already uses this fallback logic.
- **Background sync uses `TransactionTemplate`**: The `completeAuth` background thread runs outside Spring's proxy, so `@Transactional` has no effect. It uses `TransactionTemplate` for programmatic transaction management. If you add more background sync paths, you must wrap them in `txTemplate.executeWithoutResult()` — never rely on class-level `@Transactional` from a non-Spring thread.
- **`holdingRepository.flush()` is required after delete**: `deleteByAccountId` does not guarantee immediate DB flush. Without an explicit `flush()` call before inserting new holdings, Hibernate may execute INSERT before DELETE, causing duplicate key violations on `(account_id, ticker)`.
- **SyncAllModal detects TR via accounts**: TR appears in the SyncAllModal when the user has any account with `provider === "Trade Republic"`, even without an active session. When the session is expired, clicking sync opens an inline phone + PIN + verification-code form. After successful auth, the backend sync runs in background and the frontend picks up results via existing `refetchInterval`.
- **Ticker subscription exchange suffix is guessed, not provided**: `compactPortfolioByType` gives no `exchangeId`, so `TradeRepublicAdapter` appends `.LSX` for equities/ETFs and `.TRD0` for TR-native crypto. Crypto is detected via `OpenFigiIsinConverter.isTrCryptoIsin()` (prefix `XF000`), the single shared predicate so the adapter's exchange choice and the converter's ISIN parsing can't drift. If TR introduces another on-platform product family with its own dedicated exchange, it will hit the same `FORBIDDEN` symptom as issue #23 until this default is extended.
- **Private equity funds (`privateFund`) are excluded from ticker subscriptions**: TR positions with `instrumentType: "privateFund"` are not publicly traded and TR never streams a price tick for them. The adapter checks `pos.path("instrumentType")` and skips the ticker subscription for these ISINs. Their valuation falls back to `averageBuyIn` in the portfolio value calculation. Without this skip, the `expectedTickers` counter would be inflated, causing the reactive stream to block until the 45s timeout aborts the entire sync.
- **Ticker completion counts distinct subscriptions, not messages**: A *successful* TR `ticker` subscription is a stream — an initial full state followed by continuous delta updates under the same `wsId`. The stream's `takeUntil` completes once every ticker subscription has answered, tracked as a set of answered `wsId`s (`answeredTickerSubs`), and only the first message per `wsId` is read (it carries the full state a sync snapshot needs). Counting raw messages instead let a fast-ticking position push the total to the expected count before slower positions had answered even once, closing the socket early and dropping their prices to the `averageBuyIn` fallback — the same symptom as issue #23. (The reference `pytr` client `unsub`s after the first message; we simply ignore later ones.)

## Tests

- `HoldingDedupTest` -- VWAP math + null handling + order independence (see [trade-republic-holding-deduplication.md](./trade-republic-holding-deduplication.md))
- `TradeRepublicSyncServiceTest#sync_mergesDuplicateTickersWithVwap` -- wiring test: two ISINs → same ticker → VWAP-merged `averageBuyIn` persisted
- `TradeRepublicSyncServiceTest#sync_deletesOldHoldingsWhenPortfolioReturnsEmpty` -- regression test: an authoritative empty WebSocket portfolio clears previous holdings
- `frontend/src/pages/sync/TradeRepublicTab.test.tsx` and `frontend/src/components/shared/AddAccountModal.test.tsx` -- frontend regression tests for initiation failure staying on phone/PIN and TAN completion failure staying on the verification-code step
- Manual integration testing against real TR accounts (auth flow, session refresh, CSV import)
